## SOC Defined
In this lesson, I have gained an understanding of SOC team member’s daily activities and responsibilities. I learn the various roles and responsibilities of prominent SOC team members and how they interact during incident investigations. “Why such close interaction?”. 

The SOC is a centralized command center for network security event monitoring and incident response. A SOC is responsible for detecting, analyzing, and reporting unauthorized and malicious network activity by employing advanced threat-detection capabilities.

The primary function of a SOC is to provide central monitoring capabilities to detect, identify, and respond to security incidents that may impact the organization’s infrastructure, services, and customers. A SOC's fundamental objective is to detect and contain attacks and intrusions in the shortest possible time. The goal is to limit the potential impact or damage that an incident may produce by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of suspicious events. 

If a SOC can either prevent or terminate an active attack, it can inherently save an organization time, money, and possibly prevent data exfiltration. Damage to a brand's reputation may also occur, depending on the nature and extent of the attack.

# Example video
To rank the severity and impact of a breach, Jon (a security analyst or SOC analyst) can follow a structured approach using industry-standard methodologies and tools. Here's how Jon can perform the task step by step:

Jon starts by collecting critical information about the breach:

### Incident Details:
What type of breach occurred (e.g., data breach, ransomware, phishing)?
What systems or networks were compromised?
### Affected Assets:
Were critical systems, servers, databases, or endpoints impacted?
Any sensitive data (e.g., personal information, financial records) involved?
### Detection Time:
How long did the threat remain undetected (dwell time)?
Tools Jon Can Use:

### SIEM Tools: Splunk, IBM QRadar, or Elastic Stack to analyze logs and alerts.
### Endpoint Detection Tools: CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, or Carbon Black.

### Introduction to SOC Video
In this course, i learnt what a SOC is and the role that SOC plays in keeping a company's assets secure from cyber attacks.I learnt who the attackers are, why they attack, what they attempt to steal, and how they attack? I will be presented with a combination of animated videos, learning activities, content review questions, and a summary challenge to learn and reinforce these concepts. There are multiple SOC roles and corresponding procedures, and it's important that I am familiar with all of them. I'll want to have a clear understanding of each role so that you can answer the question, what role would best fit my skill set, interests, and career goals? SOC Roles and incidence response procedures are presented in multiple areas of this section. 

Reinaldo is an IT Reporter who was covering the aspects and ramifications of cyber attacks. He is currently interviewing Jon, a Security Operations Center, or SOC analyst. >> Thanks Jon for taking time out of your busy day to speak with us. So, can you tell us briefly, just what is a SOC? >> Well, in a nutshell, a SOC is the first line of defense in preventing and responding to IT security breaches. >> Jon's phone rings, he takes the call. It lasts only 30 seconds but his face turns from pleasant to serious. >> I'm sorry Reinaldo, the team has just notified me there is a situation that I need to look at, a possible breach. I gotta go. >> Jon walks into the SOC. Rajiv, the Tier 1 Analyst tells Jon this is a ransomware attack. Jon uses his analysis and toolkit to rank the severity and impact of the breach. He initially triages the event in the ticketing system. Jon determines that this is a ransomware attack that has never been seen before. This is also a zero-day attack meaning no known solution is currently available. He needs to escalate the incident to a Tier 3 Incident Responder. Let's briefly get acquainted with the SOC team. As you will see each team member has a specific role with a specific skill set. Rajiv is the Tier 1 Analyst, also known as the triage specialist. Rajiv must determine whether the alert is justified or simply a false positive. If justified, he'll escalate to the Tier 2 Analyst. Jon is the Tier 2 Analyst, also known as the incident handler. Jon will do an in-depth assessment, he will need to understand the scope of the attack and identify affected systems. Based on his analysis and his toolset, he may elevate to the Tier 3 Analyst as explained next. Rachel is the Tier 3 Analyst, also known as the threat hunter or incident responder. She is the most experienced member of the SOC operations team. Since this attack has never been seen before, all applications in Jon's toolkit will be of little or no use. Therefore, he's elevated the request to Rachel who will need to use her experience to neutralize the threat. Rohan is the SOC Manager, and is responsible for leading the SOC. He supervises, manages, and coordinates the team, and provides technical guidance when needed. It is important to note that there are additional personnel who can be considered part of the extended SOC team. While they are not dedicated members, they nevertheless provide essential information to the SOC team. Some of these members include the Chief Security Officer, or CISO who defines strategies, goals, and objectives of the organization's overall security operations. The SOC Manager reports to the CISO, the Red Team and Blue Team who tried to attack and defend respectively the organization's networks. In doing so, they attempt to identify vulnerabilities as part of a proactive approach to threat response. The Security Engineer, who develops, integrates, and maintain SOC tools, as well as defines requirements for new ones. As you can see, the SOC serves as the first layer of defense in a cyber security threat. It is made of team members with well defined roles that work together to proactively contain threats.

### SOC Environment today video
Well Jon is with the rest of the sock team responding to the breach. Meryl, at mees Chief Information Security Officer or CISO ,has agreed to continue the interview, let's listen in. >> Hi Meryl, thanks for making yourself available on such short notice. I know how busy CISOs are. My pleasure, Ronaldo. I'm sorry John couldn't continue the interview, but one of the sox primary goals is to minimize dwell time. So it's important that he jumps on this right away. >> Dwell time.

>> Yes, dwell time. This is the amount of time the cybercriminals have been inside our network prior to us knowing. Knowing that well time helps us gauge how quickly we are discovering their presence, and how long they have had to execute their malicious actions. We now know they have attempted to penetrate, if they have done so we want to know when this occurred. It's worth mentioning that the current average time required for a company to detect intrusion, is between 100 and 200 days. Based on Cisco's annual security report. >> That long, wow that must leave plenty of time for threat actors to do their work and steal corporate data. >> Yes, and that is why we perform drills to provide us information on how fast a malicious action is detected by our sock, And how fast the sock can mitigate. >> You mean that your sock proactively stages attack and defense scenarios to determine possible dwell times. >> Exactly. >> That's great information Meryl, but can you tell me who are these people or groups that make your sock teams life so difficult. >> Cybercriminals come primarily from organized crime. However, there are other sources, they can also be state affiliated, employees, or even unskilled hackers using tools they obtained on the internet. >> Gotcha, so organized crime mainly but there are many possible culprits.

But why are they attacking, what are their motives. >> As you may have guessed, the main motive nowadays is financial gain. However, there may be other secondary reasons, such as spying and other clandestine motives, such as repurposing software code for covert activities. >> Makes sense, so although there may be secondary reasons such as espionage, it all boils down to money.

So, can you talk a little bit about how they do their work?

>> Well, there are many ways to initiate a breach, the most common breaches known as phishing. This usually involves sending an email falsely claiming to be legitimate. It is usually combined with a threat and request for information, whereby the email will ask the recipient to supply confidential information such as bank account details.

Let's focus for a minute on ransomware, It is the fastest growing hacking activity.

Ransomware attacks are often initiated via a phishing attack. For example, a link to a malicious website is included, here, the bad actors will attempt to encrypt the hard drives of the target organizations computers. Rendering them unusable, and the more sophisticated attackers will then exfiltrate sensitive corporate data and threaten to publish the data if the ransom is not met. >> wow, I've heard a lot about ransomware in the news lately, but I didn't know is that sophisticated. So, even with good backups, the company that has breached can be in a tough situation. >> Meryl receives a call from the sock, confirming this is a ransomware attack and it has never been seen before. This is known as a zero day attack, this means all current malware tools are of little or of no use. She says nothing of this call to Ronaldo, while Meryl is on the phone, let's take a look at one of these bad actors. Her name is Julie and will look at her motives and her methods. She's not someone you would easily suspect, in fact, she doesn't even consider herself a hacker. [MUSIC] >> How did you decide to become a hacker? >> Well, I'm not really sure what it means to become a hacker. That's like some guy in a hoodie who types really fast and stays up all night writing code and cracking passwords. It's not me, I just spy on people and see what makes them click. You have to understand the company's organization. I get a lot of my information from the sales department because, they're always so quick and eager, they're hungry. People trust too easily they don't look at the details, I do, details matter. That's what I'm good at, it has to look completely believable. It has to look familiar, this is where research is important. It's not some generic piece of spam, it's an email from their boss with their company's signature.

It's written in the voice of the boss. It's what he would say if he were writing this. >> As you can see, she uses social media to do her work, this is known as social engineering. Julie also has a clear sophisticated strategy, and she is thorough, now that we know a little bit more about one bad actor, let's return to the interview. >> So just what corporate assets are the bad actors trying to steal. >> This can vary, it could be sensitive information stored on the company's HR servers, such as bank account and social security numbers. Or it could be intellectual property on one of the legal team's servers. Because of this interdependent nature of our assets, the sock team will work closely with all strategic departments before, during and after the breach. And during incidents response, they will collect appropriate evidence or what is commonly known as artifacts, to be used in the forensics effort during the recovery phase. >> Okay, so the different corporate departments represent different jewels for the cybercriminals, and as such. The sock team will closely interact with each one of these departments during incident response. >> Makes sense. >> And it is important to note that during all phases of the incident response procedure, Jon and his colleagues will adhere to multiple internationally recognized procedures and standards. Acme inc is an international company adhering to international standards will not only streamline legal proceedings but also ensure that all evidence is accepted in international courts of law. G I hadn't even thought of the legal ramifications of a breach. It makes sense that standards must be adhered to during incident response. So the soccer team's work stands up in international courts.

You have learned about what John and his colleagues are up against, who the bad actors are, what are their motives and what and how they attack? And you took a closer look at one of those bad actors a.

### SOC Environment Today
A SOC is an organization’s first line of defense against cybersecurity criminals, otherwise known as “bad actors.” In this lesson, you will learn who these bad actors are, their motives, why they attack, and what they attack.  

New threats can be discovered through recently identified vulnerabilities, threat intelligence gathering services, and reported observations detailing malicious anomalies across targeted industry segments.

Detecting a cybersecurity attack is a challenging task, even for highly trained security personnel. To manage today's most significant security challenges, organizations need a more straightforward, scalable, threat-centric approach that addresses security concerns before, during, and after an incident has occurred. 

Before attacks occur, in-depth analysis of network traffic has been performed to establish a baseline of normal behavior. Policies and controls can then be implemented to properly defend the environment. During an attack, it is critical to detect the presence of malware and block identified threats continuously.

After an attack, take the following actions:
-Marginalize the impact of an attack by identifying the point of entry.
-Determine the scope of the attack.
-Contain the threat and remediate the infected host.
-Minimize the risk of re-infection.

### Goal of a SOC video
We know John and the rest of these SOC team have identified the breach as a ransomware attack. While they are carrying out incidence response procedures, let's try to answer a few questions that you may have about the SOC in general. Why would a corporation consider employing a SOC? The ultimate goal of any organization using a SOC is to maintain business continuity and integrity. Revenue loss due to downtime is costly and credibility loss due to a breach can be even worse for the company. What are the strategies that a SOC uses so that an organization can reach these goals? First, the SOC team will develop a proactive strategy to reduce the time necessary to respond to a threat. In doing so, they hope to stay one step ahead of the cybercriminals. The SOC team realizes the more they know about their networks, the easier it will be to identify potential attacks. This knowledge will be gained through integration with activities like asset inventorying, continuous security monitoring, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and threat hunting. In doing so, the SOC team can recognize the signs of an attack, identify any associated activity and start remediation to eliminate the threat in the shortest possible time. Next, the SOC will work to minimize a breach's impact when one does occur. This is done by reducing the time it takes to detect the breach. How, you may ask? The SOC will prioritize its activities based on current industry threats with the aid of threat intelligence. The SOC will prioritize its activities based on current industry threats and the aid of threat intelligence. The information obtained from SOC incident response activities can help shape future corporate security strategies and governance and help with financial risk calculations from cyber threats. Let's say you are now convinced that employing a SOC is the way to go. Let's take a look at how a smooth running SOC provides incident response, thereby increasing your organization's peace of mind. The SOC team works together in the following way. A phishing email is detected by a user. The user sends the email to the SOC team as he has taken security training. The Tier 1 SOC analyst confirms this is a malicious email based on the executable attachment. The Tier 2 SOC analyst analyses using the Cisco secure malware analytics to confirm this as a zero day malware attack. Mitigation is performed by the SOC and KNOC teams. This may include one or more of the following : block the file at the end point, recall the message via the mail system, ad blocking to another mitigation control point such as an intrusion detection system. The Tier 3 SOC analyst initiates threat hunting activities, which may include one or more of the following : review mail system such as Office 365 to determine if any user has clicked on the email, check to see if the same mail piece was distributed internally or externally, review any actions that would have occurred should the email attachment be executed. Now, let's take a look at your competitor. Although they have considered engaging a SOC, they decided to wait for multiple reasons. In this topic, you learned about the goals of a SOC and the strategies used to achieve these goals. You also learned about the business benefits associated with different stages of the incident response cycle. Finally, you looked at corporate life with a SOC and without a SOC, quite a different landscape. In the next topic, we'll see that everything comes with a price. While engaging a SOC is the right step in increasing your company security posture, it brings associated challenges.

### Goal of a SOC
A threat-centric SOC can proactively hunt for malicious threats on networks. New threats can be discovered through recently identified vulnerabilities, threat intelligence gathering services, and reported observations detailing malicious anomalies across targeted industry segments. 

A compliance-based SOC can focus on evaluating the compliance posture of network systems to confirm they adhere to industry-recommended device configuration templates and standardized system builds. This type of compliance monitoring detects unauthorized configuration changes that reveal existing configuration problems that may lead to a security breach. 

Operational-based SOCs are tasked with monitoring the security posture of an organization’s internal network. Tiers 2 and 3 SOC analysts in operational-based SOCs will research, develop, and operationalize complex detection techniques that are tailored for an organization’s specific network environment.

### Challenges of a SOC
You now know more about how overwhelmingly beneficial it is to employ a SOC. But as you might expect, employing a SOC is not without its challenges. While the SOC team is still working on incident response, let's look at some of the difficulties they are up against. The challenges of utilizing a SOC can be characterized into the following areas: Technology. This includes all present and future hardware, software, on-premises, and on-premises components used for SOC operation. As technology increases in quantity and complexity so do the challenges for the SOC team. People. The most important resources owned by the SOC are their human resources. Challenges exist as a SOC employee on a day-to-day basis, as well as challenges of obtaining and retaining skilled professionals. Processes. These are the processes that a SOC undertakes to perform its work. Where processes are well defined they can be optimized, but where no documentation on these processes exist, the SOC team suffers. Governance and compliance. One of the most important tasks that falls under the realm of corporate governance is measuring a SOC's performance and efficiency. Unfortunately, insufficient metrics and unclear privacy regulations make SOC performance measurement and associated auditing complex. Information technology, IT is continuously changing and becoming more complex. The SOC is challenged by the following factors due to this increased complexity. IT infrastructures are becoming more complex and interdependent with multiple on-premises and Cloud-based components. This makes it difficult for the SOC analyst to maintain a cohesive overview. Poor visibility into the network means the SOC analyst can not keep track of all devices and associated data flows in the extended network. New and different devices are being introduced to the networks. This makes it increasingly difficult for the SOC analyst to process and make sense of the different data sources. With the increasing number of devices, more events are generated, which inevitably results in more false-positive alerts. False positives and their significance are discussed next. People. The most important resources that the SOC possesses are its people. The human resource challenges facing the SOC personnel are multifaceted and include the following : SOC analyst burnout. As mentioned earlier, there's a vast number of alerts entering into the SOC constantly. Even though the tier 1 analyst has tools to filter out all but true positive alerts, they are not infallible. The number of alerts that analysts must process manually remains quite high. It is a very monotonous task but associated with a high responsibility, and any incorrect decision can lead to serious consequences. A combination of time, pressure, and the monotonous nature of their work can often lead to burnout. Lack of skilled staff and difficult retention. Due to the issues just described, it is difficult for companies to retain skilled staff for their SOC. Companies must spend resources on maintaining the skill level of their current staff or spend additional resources on training new staff members. Lack of effective communications. Communication is typically carried out directly between analysts. Although this communication is necessary, it is also time-consuming and inefficient as it is ad hoc in nature and not supported by collaborative toolset such as Cisco SecureX and Splunk Phantom. Group collaboration tools such as these are critical for knowledge dissemination throughout the SOC team. In using these tools, the SOC members increase their knowledge base and remain motivated. Processes. Understanding the processes performed by the SOC is critical to SOC operation. For the SOC personnel to perform their tasks in an optimized, efficient, and thorough manner, they must have a clear understanding of how these tasks must be carried out. Although general security-related processes exist and are documented, they do not apply specifically to SOC operations. Documentation must be written and disseminated to identify the standards and regulations that apply to the SOC and then adapt them to the specific procedural characteristics of the SOC. Governance and compliance. One of the most important task that falls under the realm of corporate governance is measuring a SOC's performance and efficacy. Unfortunately, many of the SOC's current metrics do not map to a SOC's objectives. The deficiencies in current metrics create a need for uniform metrics that can be used to prove that SOC has achieved its business objectives. Privacy regulations. Existing privacy standards and regulations vary greatly between government bodies, such as the European Union and the United States. Due to the disparity in privacy and protection laws, international organizations have difficulty in understanding what can be collected and distributed internationally. In this topic, you learned about the challenges of employing a SOC. You learned that these challenges are both short-term, day-to-day challenges as well as long-term systemic challenges. You learned that these challenges are manifested in the areas of resources, people, processes, technology and governance, and compliance.

### Challenges of a SOC
Employing a SOC is not without challenges. These challenges can be both technical and procedural in nature. For example, the rigors of the SOC environment can cause team members to burn out if precautions are not taken.

Cybersecurity attacks and the financial and reputational damage they cause to an organization make clear the advantages of employing a SOC. As you have seen in this topic, establishing and maintaining a SOC comes with challenges, which are both day-to-day and systemic.

### WRAP UP
You now know what a SOC is, and you know the titles, roles and responsibilities of the SOC analysts. You now know the who, why, what and how of the bad actors that the SOC is continuously fighting against. You took a detailed look at one of these bad actors, was this someone you would have expected?

You also learned about the value that a SOC brings to an organization and the challenges that a SOC team faces. Through the incident response process, the SOC team mitigates cybersecurity attacks, and when they do occur minimizes network downtime. After the attack procedures are put in place to improve the company's cybersecurity posture in the future.

We hope you begin to ask yourself how you can be proactive in thwarting cybersecurity breaches in your day to day activities. And that you're excited at the possibility of joining the cybersecurity community. Make sure to continue asking yourself which SOC role you might be appropriate for, now and in the future. Thanks for joining us in this training.

In this lesson, you have learned the primary functions of a SOC and the  critical role it plays in protecting company assets from cyber-attacks.  You were introduced to the analyst roles comprising the SOC team and  their associated responsibilities during a cyber-attack. You also  learned about the bad actors that the SOC team is defending against.  Let's take a look at the video and review the important points.  

From a monitoring and detection perspective, you must understand the main differences between multiple models to choose a path for securing your daily operations. It is important to note that no two organizations are alike, and the type of SOC that you choose depends greatly (but not entirely) on the following criteria: 

Size of the organization

IT security budget

Skill set of the IT personnel

Previous incidents that the organization has encountered

Type of industry

Type of data that the organization manages each day

All these criteria have a strategic impact on the type of SOC that you can deploy.
