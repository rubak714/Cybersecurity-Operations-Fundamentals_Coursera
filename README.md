# Cybersecurity Analyst Training - Security Operations Center (SOC) Fundamentals
## Overview
This course focuses on building the foundational skills required for an Associate-level Cybersecurity Analyst working in Security Operations Centers (SOC). It highlights the essential functions of a SOC and its critical role in safeguarding organizational assets against cyber threats.

## Key Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, I have:

Understood the Role of SOC Team Members:

Gained insights into the daily activities and responsibilities of SOC analysts.
Identified Cyber Threat Actors:

Learned about the bad actors, their motives, attack methods, and targets.
Explored the Goals of a SOC:

Reviewed how implementing a SOC benefits organizations by enhancing their security posture.
Recognized SOC Challenges:

Explored both technical and procedural challenges faced in a SOC environment.

# Skills Gained
Daily operations and responsibilities within a SOC.
Identification of cyber attackers and their methods.
Business goals and benefits of deploying a SOC.
Awareness of challenges and mitigation strategies in SOC environments.

## SOC Defined
  In this lesson, I have gained an understanding of SOC team member’s daily activities and responsibilities. I learn the various roles and responsibilities of prominent SOC team members and how they interact during incident investigations. “Why such close interaction?”. 

The SOC is a centralized command center for network security event monitoring and incident response. A SOC is responsible for detecting, analyzing, and reporting unauthorized and malicious network activity by employing advanced threat-detection capabilities.

The primary function of a SOC is to provide central monitoring capabilities to detect, identify, and respond to security incidents that may impact the organization’s infrastructure, services, and customers. A SOC's fundamental objective is to detect and contain attacks and intrusions in the shortest possible time. The goal is to limit the potential impact or damage that an incident may produce by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of suspicious events. 

If a SOC can either prevent or terminate an active attack, it can inherently save an organization time, money, and possibly prevent data exfiltration. Damage to a brand's reputation may also occur, depending on the nature and extent of the attack.

# Example video
To rank the severity and impact of a breach, Jon (a security analyst or SOC analyst) can follow a structured approach using industry-standard methodologies and tools. Here's how Jon can perform the task step by step:

Jon starts by collecting critical information about the breach:

## Incident Details:
What type of breach occurred (e.g., data breach, ransomware, phishing)?
What systems or networks were compromised?
## Affected Assets:
Were critical systems, servers, databases, or endpoints impacted?
Any sensitive data (e.g., personal information, financial records) involved?
## Detection Time:
How long did the threat remain undetected (dwell time)?
Tools Jon Can Use:

## SIEM Tools: Splunk, IBM QRadar, or Elastic Stack to analyze logs and alerts.
## Endpoint Detection Tools: CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, or Carbon Black.
